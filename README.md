# Puppet Community Enablement Pipeline

The purpose of this repo is to provide resources to enable Puppet's community
to build our open source products. For now at least, we will use
[the Wiki](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community-enablement-pipeline/wiki)
in this repo for documentation and track work using
[issues](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community-enablement-pipeline/issues)
and the
"[Community Enablement](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community-enablement-pipeline/projects/1)"
project.

## Getting involved

At this point we are still working to determine what all needs to be done but
still welcome feedback. You are welcome to open new issues to document
desired outcomes or to request support for a particular OS and architecture
combination.

## Timeline

There is no set timeline for any of this. That said, a few of us are very
interested in moving this forward steadily and hope to have something to show
for it in the near-term.
