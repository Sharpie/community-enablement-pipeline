# Puppet Community Enablement Pipeline

The purpose of this repo is to provide resources to enable Puppet's community
to build our open source products. For now at least, we will use [the Wiki](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community-enablement-pipeline/wiki) for
documentation and track work using issues and projects.
